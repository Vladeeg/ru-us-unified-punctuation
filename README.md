# RU/US unified 3rd lvl symbols layouts

Always hated different placing of punctuation symbols between ЙЦУКЕН and QEWRTY layouts,
so I decided to create unified layouts using AltGr

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (or download as zip)

2. Execute `install.sh`

This will install two additional layouts to your system

3. Probably you'll need to log out and log in to the system to let layout database update correctly

4. Enable 3rd level button in keyboard settings

5. After that you can add it to layout switcher in keyboard settings
